Powerpoint: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JiJN0abmQbvqoR5bh7w7EKRbZVje20LoLzHjl4x9mCk/edit#slide=id.g6f03ac91f0_0_0

## Setup
1. Download zipped file or clone onto your desktop in a directory of your choosing.
2. If you are using a zipped file, unzip the contents.
3. Open VS Code (or editor of choice) and navigate to the code. 
*NOTE*: If you downloaded a zipped file, when you unzip your directory structure will be ph-intro-to-web > ph-intro-to-web > index.html, Part_1, Part_2, ... etc. Make sure you are inside the **same** level as index.html. 
4. Start your server. 

## Follow Along
1. You will need to download Visual Studio Code and the Live Server Plugin inside VS Code itself. You can find the plugin by opening VS Code, going to "Extensions", searching for "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey, and clicking "Install".
2. Use the powerpoint linked above or the notes available in each folder to go through a quick walkthrough of HTML, CSS, and CSS frameworks. 
3. Your goal is to add to the starter code to make it look like the result pictured in the slides. In the folder for each part, there is starter code (labelled exercise_X.X.html) as well as the final, finished version of the code (labelled finished_X.X.html) for your reference.
